Introduction:
For this project we take an existing database for a food delivery service and implement a rating system. 
This rating system will be implemented for both the restaurant and the delivery driver. They will get a score out of 10. 
There can also be many ratings for both the driver and the restaurant. When viewing a resturant you can see the min, max,
and average ratings. Drivers will also have a veiw min, max, and average ratings.

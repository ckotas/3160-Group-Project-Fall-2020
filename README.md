Introduction:
For this project we take an existing database for a food delivery service and implement a rating system. 
This rating system will be implemented for both the restaurant and the delivery driver. They will get a score out of 10. 
There can also be many ratings for both the driver and the restaurant. When viewing a restaurant, you can see the min, max,
and average ratings. Drivers will also have a view min, max, and average ratings.

# Indexs
Indexes can help to speed up the query processing. Most indexes are on the primary keys or a unique key that has a unique constraint.
In our case most of the time when we sorted we based it on the data that was created in the stored procedure and not the columns.
We did not use indexes for the sort because the data was a temporary variable that would be gone when the procedure was done. You also want to be careful because adding indexes can be costly and slow down your database.
